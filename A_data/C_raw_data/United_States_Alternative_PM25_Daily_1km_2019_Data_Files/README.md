# Air Quality Monitor Representativeness in the Contiguous United States -> **United_States_Alternativ…Daily_1km_2019_Data_Files**

## Description

**Project Objective:** Determine whether state and local governments site air monitors in areas that capture data that are representative of actual air quality. 

**Project Folder:** The United_States_Alternativ…Daily_1km_2019_Data_Files folder contains data derived from research out of the Universities of Maryland and Iowa, this dataset contains 1-kilometer resolution PM2.5 estimates in the contiguous United States for every day in the year 2019. The dataset was generated from big data (e.g., ground-based measurements, satellite remote sensing products, atmospheric reanalysis, and model simulations) using artificial intelligence. The researchers show their estimates align well with physical measurements, with 0.82 cross-validated coefficients of determination.
